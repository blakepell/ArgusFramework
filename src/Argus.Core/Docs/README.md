# ![Argus Framework Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blakepell/ArgusFramework/master/assets/Argus-Logo-Purple-64.png) Argus.Core

`Argus.Core` is the foundational library for the Argus Framework, a suite of utilities for the .NET ecosystem. This library 
provides a set of shared components, extension methods, and core functionalities designed to accelerate development, 
promote code reuse, and ensure consistency across all Argus-based projects.

As the central pillar of the framework, `Argus.Core` is engineered to be lightweight, dependency-light, and broadly compatible with a 
wide range of .NET target frameworks.
